As a cooperative team, we remind each other that we all contribute to make a project succeed and gain the most benefit.

- **How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?** 

We accomplish such things as a whole team with taking the most available skills from each one. In addition that we help others and fix the mistakes that occur.

Kindly telling and reminding of the importance of taking part in the project, otherwise it wouldn’t be fair to take credits in the end.
