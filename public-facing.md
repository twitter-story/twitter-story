**How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?** 

Kindly telling and reminding of the importance of taking part in the project, otherwise it wouldn’t be fair to take credits in the end.

**How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**
